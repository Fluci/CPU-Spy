A light weighted activity monitor.

While studying, I tend to use my computer a lot running on battery.
Sometimes there are applications in the background suddenly using a lot of CPU power draining my battery faster.

That mustn't happen! I've looked for some alternatives to Apple's Activity Monitor, but since I couldn't find a good one, I've written an application myself. And this is the result! CPU Spy is a very simple application, all it has to do, is to give you a rough idea in which state your CPU is in and offer you options to reduce energy consumption as much as possible.

This application is in continuous development if my schedule allows.
Feel free to suggest new features and improvements. But since I don't promise anything it sometimes might be faster to fork the repository, add it yourself and then send me a pull request (if you want to share it with the rest of the world). Contributors are welcome!
